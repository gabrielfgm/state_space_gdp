# Using Bayesian State Space Models to Reconcile Historical GDP Estimates

The object of this exercise is to try to reconcile historical GDP 
estimates by optimally combining them using state space models.

Given a series of measures of GDP such as <img src="svgs/9043671fccca3141f24e1a5ac4733306.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=42.19542194999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/>, <img src="svgs/161637797064c9de0b4fa81a7851a7c2.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=43.78144154999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/>, and 
<img src="svgs/3faf7b82aef81f49e22c8149b479fd88.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=44.03312429999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/>, for the income, expenditure, and output approaches to measuring GDP, we might like to optimally combine them to get a series <img src="svgs/18457b0a0e047e58a234a7ba055385fe.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=43.41917414999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/> that reflects the measurement efforts of multiple scholars. Many attempts to combine GDP measurements exist, and here we follow the approach of Aruoba et. al. as they designed the state-space estimator for GDPPlus as implemented by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve.

We stack our GDP measures into a vector <img src="svgs/39e731509d35a821a251fe62866ee4a4.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=14.50919249999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/> measured over time periods <img src="svgs/4f4f4e395762a3af4575de74c019ebb5.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=5.936097749999991pt height=20.221802699999984pt/> to <img src="svgs/2f118ee06d05f3c2d98361d9c30e38ce.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=11.889314249999991pt height=22.465723500000017pt/>. We assume that our measurements of GDP are generated by true GDP, but are corrupted by noise:

True GDP itself is latent but moves autoregressively:

An important consideration is the covariance structure of our measurements of GDP. It is reasonable to think that they are likely to be correlated, thus we model the covariance of our system as block-diagonal in the signals, so that the 4 <img src="svgs/bdbf342b57819773421273d508dba586.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=12.785434199999989pt height=19.1781018pt/> 4 matrix <img src="svgs/813cd865c037c89fcdc609b25c465a05.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=11.87217899999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/> has zeros in rows 2:4 of column 1, and in columns 2:4 of row 1.

We are unfortunately constrained initially to a block-diagonal formulation 
so that the system remains identifiable. Aruoba et. al. suggest two approaches to relaxing this assumption which I will try to incorporate later.
