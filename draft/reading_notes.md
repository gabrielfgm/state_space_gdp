## Hyndman et. al. "Optimal combination forecasts for hierarchical time series"

+ The object is articulating a method of forecasting when forecasts are hierarchically nested e.g. 'forecast all paper product sales' -> 'forecast sales of paper plates' -> 'forecast sales of red paper plates' etc.
+ May well be summation restrictions e.g. forecast on total sales means that forecast on sales line A might imply changes in forecast of sales line B
